""" This program is used for validating a file against a schema.  The
schema is written in JSON format, so the file it is validating must be
in a JSON-like format.  That means that this can be used to validate JSON
or YAML files, but the YAML files must adhere to some of the JSON rules.
The arguments of this program are the path to the file to be validated
which is ypath and the path to the schema file which is spath.
This program uses click for accepting command like arguments and options
and jsonschema to run the validation.
